**SWTIMER â€“ Multi Chronometer/Timer application**

SWTIMER lets you control multiple chronometers or timers running at the same time:

- They are displayed individually or in the dashboard
- **Individual** display:
  - User-defined colors and presets
  - User-defined time/message and presets

- **Dashboard** :
  - Updated each second
  - Individual or batch control of the chronometers and timers
  - For timers: Displays expiration time or remaining time

- **Timers** :
  - Beep on expiration
  - Optional creation of an alarm in the Clock application, going off on expiration
- **Help** file adapted to each screen


Notes:
- You're invited to install Google Clock application for correct interaction with SWTIMER
  (as some device Clock applications don't follow Android API) 
- The SWTIMER_A project needs PEKISLIB_A as library
